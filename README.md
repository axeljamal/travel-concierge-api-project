Project Name - Sojourn

# travel-concierge-api-project
- Sojourn is a website catering towards travellers where they can research destinations and see recommendations of popular sites to visit, and activities to do during their trip.
- The website is intended to be a central hub where users can access information on activities available in their destination city e.g. museums, exhibitions, cultural events, time limited events and other activities. 
- Through our website, users will be able to book tickets to activities and store these in their account so everything is accessible in one place. 
-The website is available in multiple langauges so users in different parts of the world can access its services.
- We will also feature popular restaurants and food recommendations.
- We will also provide useful information such as local healthcare services e.g. out of hours medical care, pharmacies, clinics available in the user's target language. 
- We will also include a features where users can access their local consulate or embassy in the event of an emergency. 
- We have identified a need for a service like ours due to our personal experiences travelling. Having to compile information for multiple sources, we thought it would be easier and more efficient to have one place where they can organise the details of their trip.
